# Project 3: Around The U.S.

The **Around The U.S.** project is an exciting endeavor that involves translating a Figma design into a fully functional web application. This project marks the first experience of working directly from a design file, allowing for hands-on practice with front-end development.

## Project Overview

This project showcases several essential features and techniques utilized to create a responsive web layout:

- **HTML5**: The backbone of the structure.
- **CSS**: Styling the elements for a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript OOP**: Implemented to manage project functionality and enhance code organization.
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Used for flexible and responsive layouts.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: A methodology for naming conventions to maintain a modular and maintainable CSS structure.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Maximum width set to **1280px** and minimum width to **320px** for optimal display across devices.
